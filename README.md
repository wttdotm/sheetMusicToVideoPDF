# Sheet Music Video To PDF

## How to use
This has been designed mainly to work with those sheet music channels like [musicallyyoursarnie9180](www.youtube.com/@musicallyyoursarnie9180)

### Install required stuff

`pip install moviepy yt_dlp scenedetect[opencv]`

### Run

Just drop your yt url into this command:
`python convert_video_to_pdf.py "youtubeURLHere"`

Currently outputs a long jpg, not a PDF. Working on that.
